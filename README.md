# Drei-Documentation
This repository is a work on progress.

#### "Drei" is a JavaScript library for creating and working with 3D graphics in web applications. It is built on top of WebXR and Three.js, and provides an API for creating and manipulating 3D graphics in a web browser.

#### The drei library provides a set of components and utilities for working with 3D graphics in a React-based application. It provides abstractions for common 3D tasks, such as creating and manipulating 3D objects, materials, lights, and cameras, and provides a number of pre-built components for common use cases, such as creating reflections, shadows, and animations.

#### The library is designed to make it easy to work with 3D graphics in a web application, and provides a high-level API that abstracts away many of the low-level details of working with WebXR and Three.js. This allows developers to focus on creating rich, interactive 3D experiences, rather than on the details of the underlying technology.
